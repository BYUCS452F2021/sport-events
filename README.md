Sport Events

Project Description:

- This will be a web based app that will allow users to create or join sporting events. When creating events, the user has the option of selecting   what kind of sport it will be, the city, the time of play, and the number of players needed. The creator of the event will get notifications as   other users show interest. When joining events, the user will be able to see what events are active, how many spots are left in the event and     all other needed information. 

Team:

- I am looking for 2 or 3 other people to help with the project.

SQL and NoSQL:

- Not sure what to use yet. Would appreciate suggestions.

Implementation:

- I am planning on using html and css for the front end. I am also thinking of using python (Django or Flask) or javascript (Node js) for the back end.
